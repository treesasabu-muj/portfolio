# Experimental Evaluation on Latex DRC60 Modified Bituminous Concrete Wearing Course
Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which traffic travels which is likely to undergo early deterioration. This necessitates the need for frequent maintenance and there by increases the expenditure. Since the problem of deterioration is related to the properties of bituminous concrete mix, researches have been conducted to improve the properties of the mix using additives like nanomaterials, marble dust, latex etc. The objective of this study is to modify pure bitumen using latex DRC60 and evaluate the physical properties of the blend so as to determine its optimum content in bitumen. Further Marshall mix design was carried out for bituminous concrete layer using the modified latex bitumen blend at various binder contents. The specimens were tested for Marshall stability and flow values as well as the density and void calculations. The studies conducted showed that bitumen modified with latex DRC60 had better physical properties and the modified mix had better strength compared to that of conventional bitumen.

## Abstract
Pavement is a durable surfacing of a road whose primary function is to transmit loads to the sub-base and underlying soil. Pavements are of two types: flexible and rigid. Flexible pavements consists of a mixture of bituminous material and aggregates placed on a bed of compacted granular material of appropriate quality in layers over the subgrade. Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which the traffic travels. One of the major disadvantage of flexible pavement over rigid pavement is early deterioration of surface. The pavement deterioration occurs due to high surface temperature, heavy rainfall, moisture ingress, poor subgrade, poor construction quality and heavy traffic. To improve the physical properties of bituminous concrete wearing course the materials used for the construction should be properly selected. Several ways to improve the physical properties of pavement includes use of additives such as nano materials, latex, marble dust, styrene-butadiene-styrene polymers etc.
Natural rubber (NR) latex is a cheaper and more accessible natural polymer which can improve the physical properties especially the rheological properties of bitumen. Conventional bitumen PEN 60/70 can be modified with different content of NR latex at temperature of 150Â°C. The NR latex addition is expected to reduce the temperature sensitivity of the modified binder. Also, the optimum NR latex content that can be added of the total mass of the modified binder is to be found out. Hence, as a renewable and sustainable material, natural rubber (NR) latex has the potential to be used as an effective bitumen modifier.
