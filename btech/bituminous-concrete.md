# Experimental Evaluation on Latex DRC60 Modified Bituminous Concrete Wearing Course
Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which traffic travels which is likely to undergo early deterioration. This necessitates the need for frequent maintenance and there by increases the expenditure. Since the problem of deterioration is related to the properties of bituminous concrete mix, researches have been conducted to improve the properties of the mix using additives like nanomaterials, marble dust, latex etc. The objective of this study is to modify pure bitumen using latex DRC60 and evaluate the physical properties of the blend so as to determine its optimum content in bitumen. Further Marshall mix design was carried out for bituminous concrete layer using the modified latex bitumen blend at various binder contents. The specimens were tested for Marshall stability and flow values as well as the density and void calculations. The studies conducted showed that bitumen modified with latex DRC60 had better physical properties and the modified mix had better strength compared to that of conventional bitumen.

## Abstract
Pavement is a durable surfacing of a road whose primary function is to transmit loads to the sub-base and underlying soil. Pavements are of two types: flexible and rigid. Flexible pavements consists of a mixture of bituminous material and aggregates placed on a bed of compacted granular material of appropriate quality in layers over the subgrade. Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which the traffic travels. One of the major disadvantage of flexible pavement over rigid pavement is early deterioration of surface. The pavement deterioration occurs due to high surface temperature, heavy rainfall, moisture ingress, poor subgrade, poor construction quality and heavy traffic. To improve the physical properties of bituminous concrete wearing course the materials used for the construction should be properly selected. Several ways to improve the physical properties of pavement includes use of additives such as nano materials, latex, marble dust, styrene-butadiene-styrene polymers etc.
Natural rubber (NR) latex is a cheaper and more accessible natural polymer which can improve the physical properties especially the rheological properties of bitumen. Conventional bitumen PEN 60/70 can be modified with different content of NR latex at temperature of 150°C. The NR latex addition is expected to reduce the temperature sensitivity of the modified binder. Also, the optimum NR latex content that can be added of the total mass of the modified binder is to be found out. Hence, as a renewable and sustainable material, natural rubber (NR) latex has the potential to be used as an effective bitumen modifier.

## INTRODUCTION
### GENERAL BACKGROUND
Pavement, in civil engineering is a durable surfacing of a road, airstrip, or similar area whose primary function is to transmit loads to the sub-base and underlying soil. Pavements may be either flexible, rigid or semi-rigid, according to their relative flexural stiffness. Rigid pavements are made of Portland cement concrete. Semi-rigid pavements are those having some type of chemically stabilized (pozzolanic) layer below the bituminous concrete layer. A flexible pavement structure is typically composed of several layers of materials each receiving loads from the layers above and spreading it to the next layer below. Bituminous wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which the traffic runs including any dense graded bituminous course immediately below a course of open graded bitumen. 
One of the major disadvantage of flexible pavement over rigid pavement is early deterioration of surface which can be overcome by improving the physical properties of wearing course. Several ways to improve the physical properties of pavement includes use of additives such as nano materials, latex, marble dust, styrene-butadiene-styrene polymers etc. Conventional bituminous concrete formula using the Marshall method has been shown to fail very rapidly due to heavy traffic and environmental effects. To minimize this deterioration, it is necessary to pay extra attention to material selection and one solution is to formulate an bituminous mix that has a high physical properties and one way to do this is to use latex as an additive. 

### OBJECTIVE
Bituminous Wearing course can be prepared using bituminous mix design. One of the predominant bituminous mix design is Marshall method of mix design. Wearing course is subjected to deterioration due to high surface temperature, heavy rainfall, moisture ingress, poor subgrade, poor construction quality and heavy traffic. Addition of latex into the mix is expected to increase the physical properties of the bituminous mix so that the paved surface will be capable of resisting the deteriorations. The main objectives of the study includes:
- Finding the optimum latex content and binder content in the mix
- Evaluating the changes in unit weight and voids
- Determination of  Marshall stability,
- Marshall flow value,
- Skid resistance and 
- Fatigue resistance

### SCOPE
Bituminous pavements are subjected to faster deterioration which will result in higher maintenance and operation cost. 
- Improving the physical properties of wearing course can increase the strength of the pavement and resistance to deformations, rutting, fatigue as well as skid. On the whole this can improve the overall durability of the pavement. 
- Improvement in pavement characteristics like friction and skid resistance can reduce the vehicle operation cost.
- The bitumen used is of VG 30 and latex used of DRC60 so the test results are only comprising to this bitumen grade and latex grade
- If addition of latex can improve these properties it will be a great boon. The increased demand for latex in the bituminous mix design can encourage farmers in the field of rubber plantations. Evaluation of performance of mix will be conducted for various percentages of latex from 0 to 7% and the optimum mix will be selected. 

## METHODOLOGY
### MATERIALS
The materials to be used are bitumen of VG30, aggregate and latex.  The latex to be used in the study is a natural rubber with 60% dry rubber content (DRC).  The different levels of latex to be investigated are 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6% and 7%. The aggregates must be well graded to be used in the wearing course.
### MATERIAL SELECTION AND TESTING
#### Selection of aggregates
Aggregates suitable for the mix design are selected by testing the various properties of aggregates. The properties tested include:

##### Strength
Strength of the aggregate is measured in terms of the aggregate crushing value. Sample of aggregates passing through 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on 10 mm IS sieve were selected and filled into the measuring cylinder in three layers giving 25 blows for each layer. The sample was tested for crushing in the compression testing machine at the rate of 4 tonnes per minute for 10 minutes. The crushed sample was then sieved through 2.36 mm IS sieve.
- (Aggregate crushing value=(Weight of crushed aggregates)/(Total weight of aggregate taken )  ×100)  (3.1)

##### Toughness
Aggregate impact value is taken as the measure of toughness of aggregates. Sample of aggregates passing through 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on 10 mm IS sieve were selected and filled into the measuring cylinder in three layers giving 25 blows. The sample was then tested for toughness in the impact testing apparatus by giving 15 blows of hammer. The sample thereafter was sieved through a 2.36 mm IS sieve.
- Aggregate impact value=  (Weight of sample passing 2.36mm IS sieve)/(Total weight of sample taken)  ×100  (3.2)

##### Particle shape
The particle shape is determined in terms of flakiness and elongation index. The aggregates were sieved through IS sieves of sizes 20 mm, 16 mm, 12.5 mm, 10 mm and 6.3 mm. A certain amount of fraction retained on each of the sieves were taken and passed through the length gauge and thickness gauge. The aggregates passing through the thickness gauge were taken as flaky and those retained on the length gauge were taken as elongated. According to the MORTH specifications shape of aggregates is determined using combined elongation and flakiness index. Flakiness Index test was carried out in the selected sample of aggregates. The flaky particles passing through the respective slots of the thickness gauge were removed and the Elongation Index test was carried out in the remaining non-flaky particles and the Elongation Index so obtained was noted as EI_c.
- Combined elongation and flakiness index = FI +EI_c  (3.3)
In addition the angularity of aggregates were also tested. Angularity of aggregates is defined as the absence of roundness which is of importance as it affects the interlocking properties of the compacted aggregate layer and the ease of handling the aggregate binder mixture. The test sample passing through 10mm IS sieve and retained on 6.3mm IS sieve were selected for the test and filled in the cylinder of 3 litre capacity in 3 layers giving 100 blows each. The weight of aggregate in cylinder was noted as W g, the weight of water filling the cylinder was taken as C g and the specific gravity of aggregate was determined as G. 
- Angularity number =67 -  100W/CG  (3.4)

##### Specific gravity
A sample of coarse aggregate was placed in a wire basket and immersed in water for 24 hours. The sample was weighed in water (W_1). The empty weight of basket suspended in water was also noted (W_2). The aggregates were then taken out and surface dried. The weight of the sample was then noted as (W_3). 
- Specific gravity =  W_3/(W_3-(W_1-W_2))  (3.5)
Specific gravity of fine aggregates were measured using pycnometer. The empty weight was noted. The weight of pycnometer containing fine aggregates was then noted. Thereafter the weight of pycnometer was taken along with the aggregates and water. Finally the weight of pycnometer with water only was measured. Thus the specific gravity was calculated.

##### Gradation and size
The aggregate sample was of a certain weight were taken and sieved successively through IS sieves of sizes 20mm, 16mm, 12.5mm, 10mm, 6.3mm for coarse aggregates and 4.75mm, 2.36mm, 1.18mm, 0.6mm and 0.3mm for fine aggregates. The results of sieve analysis were reported graphically.

#### Selection of bitumen
Preliminary tests were conducted to determine the properties and performance of the bitumen. These include:


##### Penetration test
The bitumen was softened to a pouring consistency and poured into a container to a depth of at least 15mm in excess of the expected penetration. The sample containers were then placed in a water bath at a temperature of 25°C for one hour. It was then taken out and placed under the penetrometer. The needle was adjusted to make contact with the surface of sample. The dial was set to zero and the needle was released for 5 seconds. The reading from the dial gauge was taken.
##### Softening point test
The softening point of bitumen was determined by the Ring and Ball test. A brass ring containing test sample of bitumen were suspended in a beaker with liquid water bath. A steel ball was placed on the bitumen sample and the liquid medium was then heated at the rate of 5°C per minute. The temperature at which the softened bitumen touches the metal plate placed at a specified distance below the ring was recorded as the softening point of bitumen.
##### Specific gravity test
The specific gravity of bitumen was determined using a pycnometer. The specific gravity was obtained by dividing the weight of bitumen by weight of equal volume of water.
##### Ductility test
The ductility value is expressed as the distance in centimetre to which the bitumen specimen of standard size can be stretched before the thread breaks. The standard briquette specimen of cross section 10 mm × 10 mm was tested at 27°C with a rate of pull of 50 mm per minute. The distance upto the point of breaking of thread was reported as the ductility of bitumen.
#### Specimen preparation
Approximately 1200gm of aggregates and filler is heated to a temperature of 175-190ºC. Binder is heated to a temperature of 121-125ºC with the first trial percentage of binder as 5% by weight of the mineral aggregates. The heated aggregates and bitumen are thoroughly mixed at a temperature of 154-160ºC. The mix is placed in a preheated mould and compacted by a rammer with 50 blows on either side at temperature of 138ºC to 149ºC. The weight of mixed aggregates taken for the preparation of the specimen may be suitably altered to obtain a compacted thickness of 63.5±3 mm. Vary the bitumen content in the next trial by +0:5% and repeat the above procedure. The latex-bitumen contents investigated varied from 5.0% to 7.0% of total mixture weight. Three specimens were prepared for each latex-bitumen content. Four levels of latex content were investigated in this study, at 0%, 2%, 4% and 6% latex by weight of bitumen respectively.
#### Density and Voids Analysis
All mix design methods use density and voids to determine basic HMA physical characteristics. Two different measures of densities are typically taken:
- Bulk specific gravity (Gmb).
- Theoretical maximum specific gravity (TMD, Gmm).

These densities are then used to calculate the volumetric parameters of the HMA. Measured void expressions are usually:
- Voids in the total mix (VIM)
- Voids in the mineral aggregate (VMA)
- Voids filled with bitumen (VFB)

#### The Marshall Stability and Flow Test
The Marshall stability and flow test provides the performance prediction measure for the Marshall mix design method. The stability portion of the test measures the maximum load supported by the test specimen at a loading rate of 50.8 mm/minute (2 inches/minute). Basically, the load is increased until it reaches a maximum then when the load just begins to decrease, the loading is stopped and the maximum load is recorded.

During the loading, an attached dial gauge measures the specimen’s plastic flow as a result of the loading. The flow value is recorded in 0.25 mm (0.01 inch) increments at the same time the maximum load is recorded. The apparatus of Marshall stability test is shown in fig.3.1.
![fig.3.1](/assets/image.png)

#### Selection of Optimum Bitumen Binder Content
The optimum bitumen binder content is finally selected based on the combined results of Marshall stability and flow, density analysis and void analysis.  Optimum bitumen binder content can be arrived at in the following procedure:
- **Plot the following graphs:**

- 	Bitumen binder content vs. density: Density will generally increase with increasing bitumen content, reach a maximum, then decrease.  Peak density usually occurs at a higher bitumen binder content than peak stability.
- Bitumen binder content vs. Marshall stability:  This should follow one of two trends: Stability increases with increasing bitumen binder content, reaches a peak, then decreases. or Stability decreases with increasing bitumen binder content and does not show a peak.  This curve is common for some recycled HMA mixtures.
- Bitumen binder content vs. flow.
- Bitumen binder content vs. air voids.  Percent air voids should decrease with increasing bitumen binder content.
- Bitumen binder content vs. VMA.  Percent VMA should decrease with increasing bitumen binder content, reach a minimum, then increase.
- Bitumen binder content vs. VFB.  Percent VFB increases with increasing bitumen binder content.

- **Determine the bitumen binder content that corresponds to the specifications median air void content (typically this is 3-5 percent).  This is the optimum bitumen binder content.**
- **Determine properties at this optimum bitumen binder content by referring to the plots.  Compare each of these values against specification values and if all are within specification, then the preceding optimum bitumen binder content is satisfactory.**

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
### GENERAL
The results of the preliminary tests conducted on aggregate and bitumen are as follows.

### RESULTS OF AGGREGATE TESTING
A sample of aggregates was taken and the following observations were recorded.
#### Aggregate Crushing Value
The aggregate crushing value should not be more than 30 % for aggregates used in bituminous surface dressing. The recorded observations of the crushing strength test are shown in Table 4.1.
Table 4.1 Test results of aggregate crushing strength test
![table 4.1](/assets/table4.1.png)
The obtained value of 26.925 % was found to be less than this limit. Hence the aggregates are satisfactory.

#### Aggregate Impact Value
The aggregate impact value should not be more than 30 % to be used in wearing course as per the MORTH specifications. The results of aggregate impact test are as shown in Table 4.2
Table 4.2 Test results of aggregate impact test

The tested sample therefore falls within the desired limit. Moreover, it is satisfactory for road surfacing.

#### Flakiness Index	
As per the IRC recommendations, the maximum limit of flakiness index of aggregates to be used in surface course is 25%. The results of the test are as shown in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Test results of flakiness index test
![table 4.3](/assets/table4.3.png)
The obtained flakiness index lies within the permissible limits. Hence the aggregates are suitable for surface dressing.

#### Elongation Index
The permissible limit of elongation index of aggregate is 25%. The recorded observations of elongation test is shown in Table 4.4. The elongation index obtained is 23.722 % which is within the desired limits.

![table 4.7](/assets/table4.7.png)

#### Angularity of Aggregates
The angularity number of aggregates generally ranges from 0 for highly rounded particles to about 11 for freshly crushed angular aggregates. The test
results shown in Table 4.8 gives an angularity number of 8, which suggests that the aggregates are nearly angular.

![Fig 4.1](/assets/fig4.1.png)

### RESULTS OF BITUMEN TESTING
A sample of bitumen was taken and the following observations were recorded after different tests. 
#### Penetration Test on Bitumen
The penetration value of bitumen was determined using a penetrometer and was found to be 65. Hence it belongs to the penetration grade 60/70.

#### Softening Point Test on Bitumen
The obtained softening point temperature of bitumen was found to be 64.1°C. Hence the bitumen can be used at higher temperatures.

#### Specific Gravity of Bitumen
Specific gravity of pure bitumen is expected to be in the range of 0.97 to 1.1. The specific gravity obtained as shown in Table 4.10 is 1.06, which is within this limit.

## CONCLUSIONS
On conclusion of the preliminary tests on aggregate and bitumen, the following conclusions are made.
-	The aggregate crushing strength as well as impact value was found to be less than 30% making it suitable for the use of wearing course.
-	The flakiness, elongation and combined elongation and flakiness indices were found to be less than 30% which indicates better interlocking between the aggregates when used in a mix.
-	The specific gravity of both fine and coarse aggregates were obtained to be 2.625 suggesting that the aggregates are good for use in road construction.
-	An angularity number of 8 obtained in the tests indicate that aggregates are nearly angular and hence this increases the workability of the mix.
-	The gradation curve follows a S shaped graph and the aggregates are well graded. Hence there will be less void spaces between the aggregates and better interlocking properties.
-	A penetration value of 65 indicates that it belongs to 60/70 penetration grade enabling it to be used sufficiently warmer climates.
-	A higher softening point temperature and ductility value obtained suggests that the bitumen is suitable to be used at warmer climates and it will not get cracked easily under heavy traffic loads.
Each of the preliminary tests conducted to determine the properties of aggregates and bitumen suggests their suitability to be used in the wearing course of pavement.
